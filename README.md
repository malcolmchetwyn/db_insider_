# DB Insider

## Introduction

This repository contains a Python script for querying a PostgreSQL database and synthesizing responses using OpenAI's GPT-4 model, integrated via the LangChain framework. It's designed to enable interactive querying of databases with advanced language model processing for enhanced insights.

You can ask it questions about the database structure through to other questions about the data.

## Features

- **SQL Database Connectivity:** Connect to a PostgreSQL database to execute SQL queries.
- **GPT-4 Integration:** Utilize OpenAI's GPT-4 model for generating comprehensive and context-aware responses.
- **LangChain Utilization:** Leverage the LangChain library for seamless integration between language models and SQL databases.
- **Interactive User Interface:** Engage with the script through a simple input/output command line interface.
- **Error Handling:** Implements basic error management for database connections and language model interactions.
